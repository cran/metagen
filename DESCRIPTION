Title: Inference in Meta Analysis and Meta Regression
Description: Provides methods for making inference in the random effects meta
    regression model, such as point estimates and confidence intervals for the
    heterogeneity parameter and the regression coefficients vector.  Inference
    method are based on different statistical approaches.  Also includes tools
    to run extensive simulation studies in parallel on high performance
    clusters.  This allows for extensive testing of current inference methods
    with new and state-of-the-art methods.  Functions for evaluating the
    performance of both point and interval estimates are provided.  Also, a
    large collection of different pre-defined plotting functions is implemented
    in a ready-to-use fashion.
