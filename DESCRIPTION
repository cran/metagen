Title: Inference in Meta Analysis and Meta Regression
Description: Provides methods for making inference in the random effects meta
    regression model such as point estimates and confidence intervals for the
    heterogeneity parameter and the regression coefficients vector.  Inference
    methods are based on different approaches to statistical inference.
    Methods from three different schools are included: methods based on the
    method of moments approach, methods based on likelihood, and methods based
    on generalised inference.  The package also includes tools to run extensive
    simulation studies in parallel on high performance clusters in a modular
    way.  This allows extensive testing of custom inferential methods with all
    implemented state-of-the-art methods in a standardised way.  Tools for
    evaluating the performance of both point and interval estimates are
    provided.  Also, a large collection of different pre-defined plotting
    functions is implemented in a ready-to-use fashion.
